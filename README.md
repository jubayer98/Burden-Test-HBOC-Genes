# Burden Test on HBOC Genes

This repository contains a dataset for the burden test analysis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) genes. The dataset includes key statistical measures that help understand the association between specific genes and the odds of developing HBOC.

## Dataset Description

- **hboc_gene**: Names the specific gene being analyzed (e.g., BRCA1, BRCA2).
- **odds_ratio**: Measures the strength of association between a gene mutation and the risk of developing HBOC. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates increased risk.
- **ci_low**: The lower bound of the confidence interval for the odds ratio, indicating the minimum likely value of the odds ratio.
- **ci_high**: The upper bound of the confidence interval for the odds ratio, indicating the maximum likely value of the odds ratio.

## Example

For the gene BRCA1:
- **odds_ratio**: 2.5
- **ci_low**: 1.8
- **ci_high**: 3.4

This suggests:
- Individuals with a BRCA1 mutation have 2.5 times higher odds of developing HBOC compared to those without the mutation.
- The true odds ratio is likely between 1.8 and 3.4 with 95% confidence.

## Purpose

This analysis helps in understanding genetic risk factors for HBOC, aiding in clinical decision-making such as enhanced surveillance and preventive measures for individuals with high-risk gene mutations.
